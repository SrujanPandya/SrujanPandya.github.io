									<h2>Academic and Profesional Career</h2>
									<p>Srujan Pandya <strong>(Yes I talk in third person!)</strong> completed his Graduation from the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar with Honours in Mechanical Engineering and Minor in Physics. Originally interested in Aerospace Engineering and Spaceflight Dynamics, he chose to build his fundamentals with the bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering. Undeterred by the lack of opportunities for his work of interest, he involved himself into electives such as Multi-Body Dynamics, Introduction to Robotics and Aircraft & Rocket Propulsion. Furthermore, he decided to strengthen the mathematical background as well as master the physics behind engineering. This led to his Minor in Physics and advanced electives in ODEs and Linear Algebra. </p>
									<p>Having a knack for research and analysis, Srujan led himself into the world of softwares and simulations. Taking up numerous projects on a variety of subfields of mechanical engineering, he exploited resources such as COMSOL Multiphysics, ANSYS Fluend and ANSYS Mechanical APDL, Autodesk Fusion 360, MATLAB Simulink, Altair Hyperworks to name a few. His primary languages have been MATLAB and Python, besides English and Hindi for communication purposes.</p>
									<p>However, if you ask about the biggest challenge he ever faced during his time at IIT Gandhinagar, then it has to be none other than <strong>*drum rolls* (in Michael Scott's voice)</strong> Quantum Mechanics. The only kind of physics that does now allow physical interpretation easily. So dependent on mathematics that one forgets it's all about atoms and subatoms. Everyone's busy solving Schrodinger's equations while the photons in the light around us going <strong>"Alright, Alright, Alright."</strong> I felt more rejected by this course than by my crushes. Ouch.</p>

									<h2>Personal Interests</h2>
									<p>I have more interests than I can invest in, currently. Yes, shift to first person narrative 'cause it's personal!!! My biggest freelance activity is writing blogs, most of them being my thoughts about the world as perceived by me, poured on paper through some strong words and often offensive opinions. The close runner-up is my love for films/tv shows and their content consumption is mainly for their critical reviews that follow. A fan of both old classics and modern masterpieces. Currently working on a screenplay at a very slow speed of 10 pages per month (and that data is exaggerated).</p>
									<p>If you ask what this lousy but ambitious douchebag is good at, then I must address the other talents that I have explored over the first quarter of my life. Music was the first one and the one I miss the most. Learnt keyboard for four years during middle school, got scared of high school too early and like every other kid in India, I believed that music as an art is less significant than math or physics. Then follows cricket, but I don't regret it. I get a weekly session of three hours which keeps me from falling into the pit of self-loathing.</p>

									<h2>What's the fuzz about Writing? Well, I'm a Cinephile!</h2>
									<p>Well, I am something of a cinephile myself. I won't say I am a verocious consumer of films and tv shows. I take it slow but I give the movie the attention and appreciation it deserves, and sometimes the appreciation it needs. Being an Indian, I got caught up in the best era of Bollywood during my childhood, and only later on was I able to give my time to Hollywood. I must clear as quickly as possible that <strong>I am NOT AN MCU FAN <i>anymore.</i></strong></p>
									<p>Interdum et malesuada fames ac ante ipsum primis in faucibus. Pellentesque venenatis dolor imperdiet dolor mattis sagittis. Praesent rutrum sem diam, vitae egestas enim auctor sit amet. Pellentesque leo mauris, consectetur id ipsum sit amet, fersapien risus, commodo eget turpis at, elementum convallis elit. Pellentesque enim turpis, hendrerit tristique lorem ipsum dolor.</p>

									<h2>Philosophy of Life</h2>
									<p>I am a classic example of a pessimist, moving towards nihilism (or so it seems). I found myself very much intrigued by and in agreement with the personality of Rust Cole - the fictional character played by Matthew Maccoughney in True Detective. If I had to take a take (pun intended) on the meaning of life, I would say <strong>(and you can quote me later)</strong>: <p style="text-align: center;"><i> "The more we search for the meaning of life, the more meaningless it seems to be."</i></p> Now while I understand some of you will have arguments countering this approach; some may even think I need medical care after they talk to me. And that is fine. I completely understand you, 'cause you're not life. Driving to work everyday with 100 other people doing the same job as you, trying to climb up the corporate hierarchy in the hope of fame and fortune, surviving in a world where educated people roam unemployed around city corners while the sweeper cleaning the city corners has a fixed wage. If all this doesn't scare you or make you wonder about what are we living for... then probably I am not the one who needs medical care.</p>
									<p>I am no messiah. No superior being. I do not believe I am the pillar of justice and order that this world needs. On the contrary, I do not believe in such superior beings. I am an atheist - like most of you when you are born. No offense. And even if you take one, it's not on me, to be honest. If you keep praying to the oven to heat your food and later on complain to the manufacturer when you find the food to be cold, then you'd be called stupid by most of the people around you. It'd be too late when you realise you never had any oven, and yet the oven company made you believe there was one only to take money from you and expand their business of manipulating gullible people. See, it's not hard to digest when I explain it metaphorically, right? </p>
